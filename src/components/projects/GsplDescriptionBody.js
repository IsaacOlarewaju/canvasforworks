      GSPL’s mission is as bold as it is compassionate: to proclaim and to
      demonstrate the gospel of Jesus Christ through creative expression and
      charitable action. Rooted in a commitment to promoting the welfare of all
      people, GSPL channels its energy into communication and alms—using
      apparel, content, and events to convey a message of truth and love to
      individuals and communities alike.
      <br />
      <br />
      I embarked on a journey to translate this mission into a visual identity.
      Guided by GSPL’s vision to use contemporary channels of communication and
      inspire action for the common good, crafting a visual identity that
      resonated across digital and physical landscapes.
      <br />
      <br />
      From logo design to social content creation, my goal was to amplify GSPL’s
      message of inclusivity and social impact. Through carefully curated
      imagery and engaging visuals, we aimed to spark meaningful interactions
      which inspire individuals to join the movement, harnessing the power of
      creativity to advance a noble cause and make a positive impact on the
      world.
